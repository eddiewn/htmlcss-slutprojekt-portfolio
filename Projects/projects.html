                                This is a web-based shopping website I created,
                                where users can browse and purchase a variety of
                                products. It features an organized product
                                catalog, a shopping cart for managing
                                selections, and a simple, user-friendly
                                interface for easy navigation. The site allows
                                users to view product details and prices, and it
                                provides a seamless online shopping experience.

                                I created a Wordle-style word guessing game
                                where players try to guess a hidden word within
                                a limited number of attempts. After each guess,
                                letters change color to show how close the guess
                                is, making it a fun and interactive puzzle
                                experience.
