                <p>I am a passionate web developer with a background in computer science and a love for coding. I specialize in creating dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly web applications that provide seamless experiences for users.</p>

                <p>On the front-end, I work with React, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and TailwindCSS to build modern, interactive interfaces. On the back-end, I leverage Node.js, ExpressJS, Laravel, and MySQL to design robust server-side logic and databases. I enjoy combining these technologies to develop full-stack applications that are both visually appealing and highly functional.</p>
